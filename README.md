1. Projec set up
2. Setting up files: 
[card.jsx] : handles rendering 
[app.jsx] : fetches Pok√©mon, holds state, passes props
[score.jsx] : shows scores
3. Defined the states in app.jsx
4. created the fetch call to the pokemon api
5. made sure the api was working and gave small css styling: encountered an error, the images we stuck to left side of the browser: forgot to include body in the layout process
